# MERRA-2_manip
NetCDF4 Interpolation Script + Visualization for MERRA-2 datasets.

These scripts are intended to work in a Jupyter notebook. Simply replace the placeholder paths with the paths matching your notebook. The interpolation packages used are from Xarray's library. May work for other datasets besides MERRA-2 prediciton engine, however this is untested and the scripts may require modification. Example shown below.
